# Chimera
Archive of a bot from the distant past. **It's highly unlikely anything still works.**

The purpose of the archive is to cause eye cancer for real JavaScript programmers, and perhaps as a reference for novel functions/methods of handling game data.

Original README is included below from the original repository on (maybe Bitbucket?)

The Chimera projects aims to bring additions and automation tools to HÎ¿wrse, with various features, some of which do and some of which don't break the game rules (as specified by the terms and conditions of play). It is up to the users of Chimera to use any features at their discretion and at their own risk.

Whilst I make every effort to ensure Chimera avoids detection, no automation program is perfect (no matter what people say!), and any script/bot can be caught with enough time and dedication from an administration team. Chimera has many features that are highly configurable, and if the users of Chimera do stupid things they may increase the possibility of being sanctioned.

I would advise if you're using the auto-farming/boarding/blupping features, don't do it for hours at a time, and ensure the random timings and breaks remain at recommended levels. Don't farm more than 1,000 horses, as a player doing 2,000 horses everyday will raise some eyebrows. Don't be consistent in the number you care for as well.


## How do I get set up?

Chimera is designed for use with the Tampermonkey browser extension for Chrome/Chromium, and I cannot guarantee that it will work under Firefox or Opera and their associated userscript extensions (Greasemonkey, etc).

It's recommended to install the latest beta version of Tampermonkey from [tampermonkey.net](http://tampermonkey.net/), as Chimera uses the latest features such as ES6 and new API's.

After installing Tampermonkey, the source code from the single .js file can be pasted as a new script using the 'Add new script' feature within Tampermonkey's menus, however Tampermonkey may detect the script if you're viewing it as a direct link source code.
